# How to add an icon

1 - Add the label to src/types/sourceTypes.ts
2 - Add an object to src/utils/socialNetwork.ts with color, category and a clean name if needed
(by default 'facebook' will be 'Facebook' so it's ok; but 'samsunghealth' is better as 'Samsung Health')
3 - Add an icon to src/components/SocialIcons.tsx - Write some dummy content here, since I need to find the icon,
Unless you found it in react-icons lib, which is the best option and installed
